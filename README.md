# Data_Design_BAX422

I took this course during my MS in Business Analytics course at UC Davis. I studied under Jorn Boehnke, a truly masterful professor and teacher.

After taking this course, you will be able to automatically extract information from most
unstructured sources, process it, and structure it for subsequent business use. This
includes knowledge in the following topics:

Regular Expressions (RegEx)
Web-Scraping
Web Data Processing
JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
MongoDB (NoSQL)
